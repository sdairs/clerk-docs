title: Analyze Clerk events with Tinybird
description: Use Tinybird to analyze events from Clerk
---

This integration enables Clerk to send events to [Tinybird](https://tinybird.co).

Before you start, you'll need to create a Tinybird Workspace.

1. From the Clerk UI, select **Configure** > **Webhooks**.
   
2. Select **Add Endpoint**.

3. In Tinybird, create a Data Source (called `clerk` in this example), with the following schema:

```tb {% title = 'Data Source schema for Clerk events %}
SCHEMA >
  'ingest_timestamp' DateTime `json:$.time` DEFAULT now(),
  'record' JSON `json:$`

ENGINE "MergeTree"
ENGINE_SORTING_KEY "ingest_timestamp"
ENGINE_TTL ""
ENGINE_PARTITION_KEY ""
```

4. Back in Clerk, paste the Events API URL in your Webhook Endpoint URL. Use the query parameter `name` to match the name of the Data Source you created in Tinybird, for example: `https://api.tinybird.co/v0/events?name=clerk`.

5. Return to Tinybird, and copy a token with priveleges to write to the Data Source you created. You can use the admin token or create one with the required scope.

6. Return to the Clerk Webhooks page, and update the URL to add a new search parameter `token` with the token you copied. The final URL looks like: `https://api.tinybird.co/v0/events?name=clerk&token=p.eyXXXXX`.

7. Select the checkboxes for the Clerk events you want to send to Tinybird, and select **Create**.

8. You're done. Any of the Clerk events you selected will automatically be sent to Tinybird via the [Events API](https://tinybird.co/docs/ingest/events-api). You can test the integration from the **Testing** tab in the Clerk Webhooks UI.
